A method of detecting an operating state of a process, system or machine based on sensor signals from a plurality of sensors is disclosed. The method comprises receiving sensor data, the sensor data based on sensor signals from the plurality of sensors and providing the sensor data as input to a neural network. The neural network comprises an encoder sub-network arranged to receive the sensor data as input and to generate a context vector based on the sensor data; and a decoder sub-network arranged to receive the context vector as input and to regenerate sensor data corresponding to at least a subset of the sensors based on the context vector. The method comprises comparing the context vector to at least one context vector classification; detecting an operating state in dependence on the comparison; and outputting a notification indicating the detected operating state.
