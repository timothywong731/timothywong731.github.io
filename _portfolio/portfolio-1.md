This is a stunning and exquisitely detailed wood carving, masterfully presented in a striking gold frame. The artwork, carved from a single piece of solid sapele, depicts a vibrant natural scene captured in a classic bas-relief style. The hardwood panel features a graceful bird as its focal point. The bird is captured mid-flight, with its wings elegantly spread and feathers intricately detailed, conveying a powerful sense of movement and freedom.
