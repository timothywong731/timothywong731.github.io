Efficiently managing travel and job scheduling for multiple engineers across various locations presents a significant operational challenge. We use a Linear Programming (LP) model designed to optimise route planning and job allocation among engineering teams, aiming to minimise travel time and adhere to individual working hours constraints. Utilising variables such as travel costs, job durations, and resource capacities, we construct a mathematical framework that accommodates each engineer's starting location and contractual obligations. Experimental results, visualised through Gantt charts and geographical plotting, demonstrate the model's efficacy in reducing total travel time while ensuring equitable workload distribution. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also contributes to the broader field of operations research by providing a scalable solution for multi-location, multi-personnel scheduling problems.

This tutorial is modified from the well-known Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (m-TSP).
