A method and apparatus for analysing utility consumption at a utility supply location is described. The method comprises the steps of: receiving utility consumption data corresponding to utility consumption at the utility supply location over a time period to be analysed; generating a recurring consumption model indicative of repeating consumption patterns in the utility consumption data; identifying divergences between the utility consumption data and the recurring consumption model; computing a diagnostic measure indicative of irregular consumption based on the identified divergences; and outputting the diagnostic measure. The diagnostic measure may be used to identify flexibility or irregularities in consumption and/or to control supply of the utility. The utility may be e.g. electricity, gas or water.
