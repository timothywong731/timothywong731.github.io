â€‹Efficiently managing travel and job scheduling for multiple workers across various locations presents a significant operational challenge. We use a Linear Programming (LP) model to optimise route planning and job allocation among multiple workers, aiming to minimise travel time and adhere to individual working hours constraints. Utilising variables such as travel costs, job durations, and resource capacities, we construct a framework that accommodates each worker's starting location and contractual obligations. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also contributes to the broader field of operations research by providing a scalable solution for multi-location, multi-personnel scheduling problems.
