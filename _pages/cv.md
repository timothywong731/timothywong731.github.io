* Senior Data Scientist
  * Centrica plc (Staines-upon-Thames, United Kingdom)
  * Served as the Technical Lead of a government-funded smart meter research programme with circa £700k budget. I have engineered and implemented a novel algorithm for energy theft detection. Empirical evidence collected through field trial suggested potential for substantial service improvement. The resulting inventions have been patented.
  * Led the analytics project for the Exploration and Production division. I applied text mining algorithms on large corpus of machine maintenance records and identified vulnerable components at one of the major natural gas terminals in the UK. The results were used to improve maintenance schedules.
