A method of detecting conditions indicative of energy meter tampering, meter faults or energy loss (e.g. due to energy theft) is disclosed. The method includes receiving energy consumption data from an energy meter indicating consumption of energy at a location served by the energy meter. Event data is also received from the meter comprising one or more events generated by the energy meter. The consumption data is analysed to detect a predetermined consumption condition. The event data is analysed to detect a predetermined event or event pattern in the event data. An alert condition is generated in response to detecting both the consumption condition and the event or event pattern.
